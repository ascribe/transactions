The intent here is to provide some kind of fundamental knowledge with respect
to bitcoin. 

In order to present the information, we'll use the same three pillars as in
:ref:`under-the-hood`. That is:

* :ref:`bitcoin-network`
* :ref:`bitcoin-addresses`
* :ref:`bitcoin-transactions`

In addition to the above three pillars, we'll add a more theroretical section
involving cryptography, data structures, and algorithms.

* :ref:`computer-science-of-bitcoin`


.. _bitcoin-network:

        protocol



.. _bitcoin-addresses:

*****************
Bitcoin Addresses
*****************

.. todo:: Explain what a bitcoin address is, starting from the point of view of
    a public key as an identity.
